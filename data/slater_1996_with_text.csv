Alabama,University of Alabama,-87.533756,33.205585,-86,28,Vivian Malone,1965,NA,"In February 1956 Autherine Lucy was the first black student to enroll at the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa. Three days later when Lucy was leaving a classroom building, an angry mob yelling ""n**** whore"" hurled rocks, eggs, and tomatoes at her. She was forced to leave the Vivian Malone scene face-down m the back of a state police car. The university suspended Lucy the next day ""for her own safety"" and shortly thereafter she was expelled from the university. For the next seven years, no black students were permitted to enroll at the Tuscaloosa campus. In June 1963 Vivian Malone and James Hood entered the university under federal court order but only after Governor George Wallace had made his infamous stand in the schoolhouse door. Hood later graduated from Wayne State University. Malone maintained outstanding grades and graduated in 1965 with a degree in personnel management. Unable to find employment in Alabama, Malone worked in Washington for the Justice Department and later the Veterans' Administration. In 1969 she moved to Atlanta when her husband was accepted at the medical school at Emory University. Malone raised two children in Atlanta and worked for the Environmental Protection Agency. She also founded a successful real estate company."

The earliest black graduate of record was Elgie Mike Bateau, who received a bachelor's degree in history in 1935. While attending the university, Batteau was not permitted to live in the university dormitories or to eat at its lunch counters. A decade after graduation, Batteau earned a master's degree.

Arkansas,University of Arkansas,-94.178214,36.06153,-92.2,35.1,Maxine Sutton and Billy Whitfield and Marjorie Wilkins,1955,1,"In 1948 the initial racial integration of the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville occurred in graduate programs that were not available at the racially segregated University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff. By 1954, 15 black students were enrolled in various graduate programs. But African Americans were still not permitted to enroll undergraduates at Fayetteville. Finally, in 1955, the first three black undergraduates - Maxine Sutton, Billy Rose Whitfield, and Marjorie Wilkins - were permitted to enter the nursing program at the Fayetteville campus. They were not allowed to live or eat on campus. All three women completed the nursing degree program."
California,University of California,-122.258423,37.871853,-118,35.5,Charles Carpenter,1905,NA,"The first black student to enroll at the University of California at Berkeley appears to be Alexander Jones of San Francisco. Jones enrolled in 1881. There is no evidence that he earned a degree, and the university has no information on what became of this educational pioneer. The University of California archives contain a letter written by Charles E. Carpenter, a confirmed graduate of the Class of 1905, in which Carpenter claims he is the only black ever to have graduated from the school at that time. In his letter, written to secure a job as a messenger in the U.S. Senate, Carpenter wrote: ""I have learned that the capacity is usually filled by a colored man. I am inspired to strive for the position because I feel that Senator Perkins would prefer a man who is a resident of his state and furthermore a graduate from the university of his own state. And since I am the only colored graduate of the University of California, I feel that my preference might excel, in the senator's judgment, that of any other colored man east or west."" Vivian Rogers, class of 1909, was the first black woman to earn a degree at Berkeley."
Colorado,University of Colorado,-105.267061,40.004415,-105.267061,39,Lucille Jones,1918,NA,"Records of racial classifications of students were not kept at the University of Colorado in the early part of this century. For many years, officials believed that in 1924 Ruth Cave Flowers was the first African American to graduate from the university. Flowers went on to earn a master's in education in 1930. However, recent evidence has come to light that the first black graduate was most likely Lucille Buchanan Jones, who earned a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences in 1918. A Denver couple revealed that they had visited Jones, who was then blind, at her home. Jones told them she was the daughter of James Buchanan, a black Union Army officer, and Sarah Buchanan, who was half white. The couple had moved to Denver from Virginia in 1866 to manage property for P.T. Barnum. Lucille Buchanan Jones told the Denver couple that at the time of her graduation she was informed that she was the first black to earn a degree from the institution. Lucille Buchanan Jones died in 1989 at the age of 105."

Delaware,University of Delaware,-75.753579,39.679782,-65.8,40,Isaiah DeGrasse,1836,NA,"The University of Delaware at Newark was established in 1743 but did not become a degree-granting institution until 1833. The first class of graduating students in 1836 consisted of five men, one of whom, Isaiah G. DeGrasse was black. DeGrasse was from New York City. He was a member of the Delta Phi Literary Society on campus. He later earned a master of arts degree from the university in 1839. It is likely that DeGrasse was the first black student to earn a master's degree from what is now a flagship state university. Despite DeGrasse's pioneering effort in the world of African-American higher education, the story of the integration of the University of Delaware must be told in two parts. Prior to the Civil War, Delaware was a slave state. Residents of Delaware were deeply divided on which side to support in the Civil War. The state remained in the Union, but after the war Delaware behaved very much like a southern state in its actions to disenfranchise its Negro citizens and to enforce segregation in all aspects of society. Delaware State College was established in 1891 for black tudents, while Newark College remained exclusively for whites. In 1921, when Newark College was rechartered as the University of Delaware, no black students had been allowed to enroll since the Civil War. In 1949 Elbert C. Wisner, a native of Elwood, Kansas, and a student at the University of Colorado, sought to transfer to the highly regarded engineering program at the University of Delaware. Wisner's mother was then a professor at the all- black Delaware State College. He was accepted and in 1952 graduated with a degree in electrical engineering. Wisner was the first black graduate of the modern era. He spent most of his career as a civilian electronics engineer for the U.S. Army. Now 72 years old, Wisner is an avid golfer and plays the alto saxophone and clarinet. He lives in southern New Jersey."
Florida,University of Florida,-82.361195,29.638248,-77.5,27.6,Stephan Mickle,1965,NA,"The University of Florida does not know the identity of its first black graduate. We do know that the first seven black students to attend the university as undergraduates enrolled in September 1962. One of those students, Stephan Mickle, who graduated in 1965 and who later became a county judge, reported that throughout his four years of college and three years of law school at the University of Florida, he never met another black student in any of his classes. The initial integration of the University of Florida did not occur until 1958. In 1949 Virgil Hawkins, a member of the faculty at Bethune-Cookman College in Daytona, had applied for admission to the law school at the University of Florida. He was denied admission first by the university, then by the board of regents, then by the state attorney general, and finally by the Florida Supreme Court. At the time, Supreme Court Justice Glenn Terrell wrote that racial segregation was the natural state of human beings: ""When God created man, he created each race to his own continent according to color, Europe to the white man, Africa to the black man, and America to the red man."" Finally, the state agreed to integrate the law school if Hawkins would withdraw his application. He did so and earned his law degree elsewhere. He was admitted to the Florida bar in 1977. Hawkins died in 1988. In 1992 the University of Florida, recognizing the contribution Hawkins made to the institution, named a law clinic in his memory."
Georgia,University of Georgia,-83.377319,33.948006,-78,30.2,Hamilton Holmes and Charlayne Hunter,1963,NA,"Established in 1785, the University of Georgia at Athens is the oldest state-chartered university in the United States. However, for the first 176 years of its history the university did not admit black students. In 1959 two black teenagers, Hamilton Holmes and Charlayne Hunter, applied for admission. Despite superior academic records, they were denied admission. The university claimed that there was no room in the dormitories for the two black students. Holmes enrolled in Morehouse College and Hunter attended Wayne State University. In 1960 they applied to the University of Georgia as transfer students. Again they were denied admission. After a four-month court battle, the two black students were ordered to be admitted. On January 9, 1961, both Holmes and Hunter were allowed to enroll. Two days later an antiblack riot rocked the campus and the atmosphere for the two black students became extremely hostile. Holmes reported that on occasion he would go entire days without anyone on campus saying one word to him. Both remained in school and graduated in 1963. Hamilton Holmes went on to Emory School of Medicine and is now an orthopedic surgeon in Atlanta. Charlayne Hunter married Ronald Gault and they had two children.

Black students had attended Indiana University for at least 22 years prior to Neal's graduation, but he was the first to earn a degree. Little is known about Neal's experiences at the university. At the time, however, Indiana University had a distinctly southern flavor. People in the surrounding area had been proslavery and many university students and alumni were from the South. It was often remarked wryly that the Mason-Dixon line should have been moved north of Bloomington. Preston Eagleton, a black student who graduated a year after Neal, was forced to sit by himself in class because white students refused to be near him. A star football and baseball player, Eagleton was not allowed to play football against the University of Kentucky, whose coaches told Indiana officials that his presence on the field would not be tolerated."

Oklahoma,University of Oklahoma,-97.445717,35.205894,-100.5,36.3,Ada Sipuel,1951,2,"Though the University of Oklahoma is unsure of the first African American to earn a bachelor's degree, the integration of the university's graduate programs is well documented. In 1946 Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP organized a carefully choreographed challenge to southern segregation. Ada Louis Sipuel, a young black woman who had graduated with honors from Langston University, applied to the University of Oklahoma College of Law. Because Norman, Oklahoma, where the university is located, did not allow blacks in town after sunset, Sipuel stipulated that if admitted she would commute to the law school each day from Oklahoma City. To no one's surprise, she was denied admission. The NAACP legal team sprang into action. The case eventually reached the Supreme Court in 1948. The Court unanimously ruled that if the state did not set up a separate law school for blacks, it would be required to admit Sipuel to the University of Oklahoma. Within days Oklahoma established the Langston University College of Law located in the fourth-floor offices of the state capitol building. Three white attorneys were appointed to the faculty. When Sipuel again reapplied to the University of Oklahoma law school, her application was refused. She was once more referred to Langston. But the NAACP had not played every card in its hand. Two days after Sipuel was rejected at the University of Oklahoma, six black students, including 68-year-old George W. McLaurin, applied to six other graduate schools at the institution. There was no graduate program for blacks at Langston in any of the six disciplines. Faced with the monumental and costly task of establishing a string of separate graduate schools for blacks, the state finally gave in. McLaurin was the first to breach the racial barrier when he was admitted to the University of Oklahoma to pursue a doctorate in education. But because a separate black law school existed on paper, Sipuel was still denied enrollment at the University of Oklahoma College of Law. In June 1949, with McLaurin and other black students now enrolled at the Norman campus, the state closed the Langston law school and Sipuel was finally permitted to study law on the campus of the University of Oklahoma College of Law. She earned her law degree in 1951."
